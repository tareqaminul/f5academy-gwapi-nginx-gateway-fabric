## NGF
NGINX Gateway Fabric provides an implementation of the Gateway API using NGINX as the data plane. The goal of the project is to implement the core Gateway APIs needed to configure an HTTP or TCP/UDP load balancer, reverse proxy, or API gateway for Kubernetes applications.

For a list of supported Gateway API resources and features, see the Gateway API Compatibility documentation.
